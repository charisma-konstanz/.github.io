Git branching:

release: The release branch is used for preparing a new version for production, involving final testing and bug fixes before merging into main.
origin/main: The main branch contains the production-ready, stable code that is live and deployed.
origin/develop: The develop branch holds the latest development code, including new features and bug fixes, that is still being tested.
feature: The feature branches are used for developing new features, and they are merged into develop once completed.
fixes: The hotfix branch is used for quick fixes to production issues, directly merging into both main and develop
